## Offline-First Architecture

### Service Worker Implementation
```typescript
// Key offline capabilities:
- Cache static assets (CSS, JS, images)
- Cache API responses for entries
- Queue failed uploads for retry
- Store draft entries in IndexedDB
- Background sync when connection returns
```

### Local Storage Strategy
- **Draft Entries**: Save to IndexedDB every 30 seconds
- **Photo Uploads**: Queue with retry mechanism
- **Audio Files**: Compress and queue for upload
- **User Sessions**: Persist JWT tokens securely

## Error Handling & Fallback Strategies

### Transcription Services (Priority Order)
1. **Primary**: AssemblyAI Speech-to-Text API
2. **Fallback 1**: OpenAI Whisper API
3. **Fallback 2**: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text
4. **Manual**: Text input if all services fail

### GPS Data Sources (Priority Order)
1. **Primary**: Garmin Connect API
2. **Fallback 1**: Strava API
3. **Manual**: Location input with Google Places autocomplete

### File Upload Resilience
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff
- Chunked uploads for large files
- Progress persistence across page refreshes
- Upload resume capability

## Performance Optimization Checklist
